ORACLE 12CR1 NON-RAC DATABASE ON VIRTUALBOX
=============================================
https://www.realdbamagic.com/installing-oracle-12-1-0-2-part-1/

If using 'virtualbox' or otherwise, build for 12cR2 RAC - follow document linux-oel75-for-rac12cR2.txt

If using 'virtualbox' logon as root and add 'vboxsf' group to Oracle as additional group
--> That is necessary for Oracle to view the host directories mounted onto VM

Logon directly as 'oracle' user - not as 'root' or 'vagrant' and then su to oracle
Start xterm 

Run /media/12cR1/database/runInstaller

Choose the following:
- Configure security updates - uncheck, and decline
- Installation option - DB software only
- Grid installation option - Single instance database installation
- Product languages - English (chosen automatically) - no need to choose English UK
- Database edition - Enterprise Edition
- Installation location - Oracle Base = /u01/app/oracle  Oracle Home = /u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_1

- Inventory directory - /u01/app/oraInventory
- Inventory Group - oinstall
(here, it may error saying incorrect ownership for inventory directory - then, make it oracle:oinstall (not grid) and 775/755)

- OS Groups:  
--> chose 'dba' (default) for all groups --> and, left 'OSOPER' as 'oper' (default)
       'dba'  groups - OSDBA, OSBACKUPDBA, OSDGDBA, OSKMDBA
       'oper' groups - OSOPER
--> 'oper' group exists as part of Oracle Enterprise Linux install - we can assign it to another user and see how it behaves

- Prerequistes checks
--> observe and fix any errors
--> one error could be 'oracle' user does not belong to 'oper' group
      then, add 'oracle' to oper group:
      [root@oraclenr1 app]# usermod -g 54321 -G 54321,54322,54333,982,54323 oracle
      [root@oraclenr1 app]# id oracle
      uid=54321(oracle) gid=54321(oinstall) groups=54321(oinstall),982(vboxsf),54322(dba),54323(oper),54333(asmdba)
      
- Summary page
--> Here, save the response file - for silent install later
--> as /home/oracle/db.rsp.from_runInstaller or something
