ADD A HOST TO AN INVENTORY
==========================

https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/9rb3nb/adding_a_host_to_ansible_tower_inventory_through/

Create a payload.json file that looks something like this:

{
    "name": "localhost",
    "description": "this is a test host added via API",
    "enabled": true,
    "instance_id": "",
    "variables": "ansible_connection: local"
}
Then here's an example curl command:

curl -u {USER}:{PASS} -X POST -d @payload.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k https://www.example.com/api/v2/inventories/{INV_ID}/hosts/

CREATE AN INVENTORY WITH SCM/GIT SOURCE

--> Per this site, first we have to create a group and then add a source to the inventory in it...??
    I ultimately found an answer to this problem- you cannot create a new inventory source by the current API. 
    Instead, it is created for you when you create an inventory group. 
    To edit this inventory source, you can find its ID (in the related fields for the inventory group you created), 
    and make a PUT request to edit.

    The easiest approach I found to testing was to use the Web Interface and my Browser's Network Inspector, 
    as I could see what API calls were being made as I performed particular tasks.
 
Something like this:
1. first create an inventory
2. next create a group for that inventory
3. then edit the source for the inventory group


APIs:
POST /api/v2/inventories/ - create an inventory
POST /api/v2/inventories/{id}/groups/ - Create a Group for an Inventory

1. CREATE THE INVENTORY (EMPTY INVENTORY)
NOTE: Organization '2' is the key for the organization - not the name (do a GET on organizations to find the key)
NOTE: The python call is to format the output properly

$ curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  \
-d '{"name":"pye-prod-001","description":"pye-prod-001","organization":"2","kind":""}'        \
https://110.160.151.4/api/v2/inventories/      | python -m json.tool

2. CREATE A GROUP FOR THE INVENTORY (with same name as the inventory for convenience)
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  \
-d '{"name":"pye-prod-001","description":"pye-prod-001"}'        \
https://110.160.151.4/api/v2/inventories/25/groups/ | python -m json.tool
