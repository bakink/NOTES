GOROUTINES
===========
2k mem, grows as needed (vs 1mb per thread in os threads)
Go does its own connection pooling - so, if there are many threads from programs, go sends them to OS only as needed

- SYNC PACKAGE
golang.org/pkg/sync

Waitgroups - to make a goroutine wait on other goroutines
- Like a supervisor goroutine - waits for a collection of goroutines to finish

Mutexes - to manage shared memory

Main functions in sync package:
WaitGroup
Mutex
RWMutex
