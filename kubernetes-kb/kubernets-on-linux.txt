KUBERNETES ON LINUX - INSTALL, CONFIG, BASICS
================================================

From scratch - https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/scratch/#software-binaries
-> to know a few things on downloads, network, keys etc
-> NOT really for full installation instructions

Using yum - https://www.linuxtechi.com/install-kubernetes-1-7-centos7-rhel7/

These look full-fledged:

============================
FIRST, A FEW THINGS
============================
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/

Container Software -
runtime (CRI, Container Runtime Interface) - 
  Like Docker (other container runtimes are also supported)
  The container runtime used by default is Docker, which is enabled through the 
  built-in dockershim CRI implementation inside of the kubelet
  Others are: containerd (CRI plugin built into containerd), cri-o, frakti, rkt
        Refer to the CRI installation instructions for more information.

Master - 
kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.

Nodes - 
kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.

Client (CLI) -
kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.

ETCD & API Server - 
https://apassionatechie.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/kubernetes-from-scratch-on-ubuntu-16-04/
Kubernetes use etcd, a distributed database with strong consistency data model 
to store the state of whole cluster. API Server is the only component that can talk to etcd directly, 
all other components (including kubelet) have to communicate through API Server. 

===================
MASTER
===================

Method1: Via apt-get (possibly using yum also):
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/
See section "Installing kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl"

Method2: Using the tar files - TBD
Possibly use https://apassionatechie.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/kubernetes-from-scratch-on-ubuntu-16-04/

NODES

INSTALL DOCKER
