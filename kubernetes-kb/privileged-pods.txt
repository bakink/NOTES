PODS IN KUBE-SYSTEM CAN CREATE OBJECTS ON HOST-KUBERNETES
==============================================================================

That is possible because the token of kube-system namespace is automatically injected into kube-system pods.

The certificate-creator pod runs "kubectl" command to create the ssl secret.  
How does it get access to the cluster which is on the host?  
I did not see any kubeconfig or other config being copied over to the pod...


Pods automatically have token injected unless automountServiceToken: false is set
So pods in kube-system will have kube-system service account token by default.
Kubectl automatically will figure out it is inside a pod and use that token
