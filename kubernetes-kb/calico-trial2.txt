ROUTABLE/NON-ROUTABLE IP RANGES
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/528538/non-routable-ip-address
For IPV4 the non-routable addresses ranges are from 10.1.1.1 to 10.255.255.254, 
from 172.16.1.1 to 172.31.255.254, and from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.255.254. 
These IP addresses will not be recognized outside of a private network.

WHAT IPS TO USE

kc00:
VM IP (intnet) - 192.168.11.100
VM IP (bridged/host-only) - TBD TBD - 192.168.21.100
KUBERNETES POD IP CIDR  - 172.16.0.0/16  (https://serverfault.com/questions/931061/helm-i-o-timeout-kubernetes)
--> Don't use the same range as VM (like 192.168.0.0) - which seemed to cause problems in earlier calico trial
