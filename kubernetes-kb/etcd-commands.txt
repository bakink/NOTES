HEALTH CHECK
==============================
https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/v2/admin_guide.html

- Using curl
# curl -L http://127.0.0.1:2379/health
{"health": "true"}

Also, you can use individual node IP instead of 127.0.0.1
--> do that for each node to know health of each member

- Using etcdctl
-- Find the location of etcdctl
# find . -name etcdctl -print
