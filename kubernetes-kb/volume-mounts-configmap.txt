VOLUME MOUNTS TO INJECT CONFIGMAPS

The configMap resource provides a way to inject configuration data into Pods. 
The data stored in a ConfigMap object can be referenced in a volume of type configMap 
and then consumed by containerized applications running in a Pod.

When referencing a configMap object, you can simply provide its name in the volume to reference it. 
You can also customize the path to use for a specific entry in the ConfigMap. 
For example, to mount the log-config ConfigMap onto a Pod called configmap-pod, you might use the YAML below:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: busybox
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config-vol
          mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
    - name: config-vol
      configMap:
        name: log-config
        items:
          - key: log_level
            path: log_level
            
The log-config ConfigMap is mounted as a volume, and all contents stored in its log_level entry 
are mounted into the Pod at path “/etc/config/log_level”. 

Note that this path is derived from the volume’s mountPath and the path keyed with log_level.

Caution: You must create a ConfigMap before you can use it.
Note: A Container using a ConfigMap as a subPath volume mount will not receive ConfigMap updates.
