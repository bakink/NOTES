SERVICE ENDPOINT UPDATES
=============================

Sometimes endpoints of a service do not get updated quickly - so apps that call that service may get stale IPs to connect to.

From the website:  https://engineering.dollarshaveclub.com/kubernetes-fixing-delayed-service-endpoint-updates-fd4d0a31852c
    My first attempt at resolving this issue was adding more endpoint 
    controller workers by tweaking the --concurrent-endpoints-syncs flag of kube-controller-manager. 
    This had little effect. After more code reading and research, 
    I discover the --kube-api-qps flag and its sister--kube-api-burst. 
    These flags sets the rate limit for all kubernetes api requests by any 
    controller within the kube-controller-manager (including the endpoints controller). 
    The default is 20 but that is clearly not enough for the workload our cluster runs. 
    After some trial and error, I determined a more suitable value that made the above log entry disappear. 
    In our case, 300 and 325 were the magic numbers. 
    With that change,Endpoints started to update immediately as pods were added and removed.

    Just a fair warning, the larger those flags are, the more load that is placed on the api server and etcd. 
    In our case, the increase in load was worth solving this problem once and for all.
