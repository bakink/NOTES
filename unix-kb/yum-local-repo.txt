To set up a Yum repository, follow these steps:

- Install the createrepo package. To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root:
yum install createrepo

- Copy all packages that you want to have in your repository into one directory, such as /mnt/local_repo/

- Change to this directory and run the following command:
createrepo --database /mnt/local_repo

- This creates the necessary metadata for your Yum repository, as well as the sqlite database for speeding up yum operations.

- When finished, add the repository to your yum config, e.g put the following to /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo

[local]
name=Local Repository Demo
baseurl=file:///mnt/local_repo 
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
protect=1
