To set up a Yum repository, follow these steps:

- Install the createrepo package. To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root:
yum install createrepo

- Copy all packages that you want to have in your repository into one directory, such as /mnt/local_repo/

- Change to this directory and run the following command:
createrepo --database /mnt/local_repo

- This creates the necessary metadata for your Yum repository, as well as the sqlite database for speeding up yum operations
It will create a subdirectory 'repodata' with files as follows:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  572 Aug  8 04:25 filelists.sqlite.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  167 Aug  8 04:25 filelists.xml.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  539 Aug  8 04:25 other.sqlite.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  162 Aug  8 04:25 other.xml.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1089 Aug  8 04:25 primary.sqlite.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  174 Aug  8 04:25 primary.xml.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1953 Aug  8 04:25 repomd.xml

- When finished, add the repository to your yum config, e.g put the following to /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo

[local]
name=Local Repository Demo
baseurl=file:///mnt/local_repo 
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
protect=1
