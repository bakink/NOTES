To set up a Yum repository, follow these steps:

Install the createrepo package. To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root:
yum install createrepo

Copy all packages that you want to have in your repository into one directory, such as /mnt/local_repo/

Change to this directory and run the following command:
createrepo --database /mnt/local_repo

This creates the necessary metadata for your Yum repository, as well as the sqlite database for speeding up yum operations.
