Method 2: Using audispd
Method 1: Rsyslog remote logging --> first goes to local rsyslog which possibly can send it to a remote logger

================
USING RSYSLOG - to be tested
================
Using rsyslog:
https://serverfault.com/questions/202044/sending-audit-logs-to-syslog-server

On the sending client (rsyslog.conf):

# auditd audit.log  
$InputFileName /var/log/audit/audit.log  
$InputFileTag tag_audit_log:  
$InputFileStateFile audit_log  
$InputFileSeverity info  
$InputFileFacility local6  
$InputRunFileMonitor
Note that the imfile module will need to have been loaded previously in the rsyslog configuration. This is the line responsible for that:

$ModLoad imfile
So check if it's in your rsyslog.conf file. If it's not there, add it under the ### MODULES ### section to enable this module; otherwise, the above configuration for auditd logging will not work.

On the receiving server (rsyslog.conf):

$template HostAudit, "/var/log/rsyslog/%HOSTNAME%/audit_log"  
local6.*
Restart the service (service rsyslog restart) on both hosts and you should begin receiving auditd messages.
