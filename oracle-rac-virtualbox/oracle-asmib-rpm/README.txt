Oracle ASMLib Downloads for Oracle Linux 7

Note: All ASMLib installations require the oracleasmlib and oracleasm-support packages appropriate for their machine.

The oracleasm-support package can be downloaded from the Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) if you have an active support subscription, or from http://public-yum.oracle.com if you do not. 

The oracleasm kernel driver is built into the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel for Oracle Linux 7 and does not need to be installed manually. 

The oracleasm kernel driver for the 64-bit (x86_64) Red Hat Compatible Kernel for Oracle Linux 7 can be installed manually from ULN or http://public-yum.oracle.com using the yum tool:
# yum install kmod-oracleasm

This kernel driver is not version-specific and does not need to be upgraded when the kernel is upgraded.

Also, see the release notes.
