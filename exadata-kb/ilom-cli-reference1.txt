Unix Quick Reference : ILOM ( Integrated Lights out Manager) Command Line
BY RAMDEV · PUBLISHED JUNE 29, 2012 · UPDATED AUGUST 20, 2014

The X4000 Family implements the ILOM – Integrated Lights Out Manager.  This is a combination of dedicated hardware and supporting software.

The Sun Fire X64 family of servers implement a technology called ILOM – Integrated Lights Out Manager where available. This is a combination of dedicated hardware and supporting software built on a service processor, integral to the platform.

Introduction

ILOM uses a hierarchical namespace.
It contains a predefined tree /SP namespace manages the ILOM. e.g. to manage users and clock settings. The SP namespace is generic over all platforms using the ILOM. /SYS namespace manages the host system. e.g. change the host state, read sensor information, and access other information for managed system hardware. The SYS namespace is unique to each platform.

 

 

Command Syntax
Command syntax can be separate or in combination:

Individually:

-> cd /SP/services/http
-> set port=80

Single combined command:

-> set /SP/services/http port=80

Useful ILOM CLI Commands:

Display SP firmware version:

-> version

Show available CLI commands:

-> show /SP/cli/commands

Display help information about commands and targets

-> help

For help specific to a command, use help followed by the command of interest, for example:

-> help start

Display status information about the controller board in your server (the command path to the board will vary within the X4000 family):

-> show /SYS/MB/P0

Connect to host serial console (host COM0):

-> start /SP/console

Power on host:

-> start /SYS

Power off host:

-> stop /SYS

Reset host:

-> reset /SYS

Reset ILOM:

-> reset /SP

Resetting the ILOM and BIOS Passwords:

Requires changing a hardware jumper within the server enclosure

Exit the ILOM CLI:

-> exit

Send break to the host:

Escape + B (press the Escape key and type upper case B)

Start the server console:

-> start /SP/console

Exit the server console   (   type ESC  –  to exit the console (usually for x86)    or     #.     –   usually for SPARC )

-> show /SP/faultmgmt

/SP/faultmgmt

Targets:
shell
0 (/SYS)
1 (/SYS/BL1)
2 (/SYS/BL2)

Properties:

Commands:
cd
show

 

–> show faulty

The show faulty command is a shortcut for the following Oracle ILOM CLI command string: -> show -o table -level all /SP/faultmgmt.  It shows you all active faults in the system in a concise, tabular form. For example, it produces output similar to the following:

 

-> (

List users with open sessions to the system console (who is using the console?):

-> show /SP/sessions

Terminate a server console session started by another user:

-> stop /SP/console

Display SEL (System Event Log)

-> show /SP/logs/event/list

Clear all System Event logs:

-> set /SP/logs/event clear=true

Locate LED – a white LED to help find a server.

Enable locate LED:

-> set /SYS LOCATE=on

Disable locate LED:

-> set /SYS LOCATE=off

Configuring a Static IP Address

Set the working directory:

-> cd /SP/network

Specify a static Ethernet configuration:

-> set pendingipdiscovery=static

-> set pendingipaddress=xxx.xxx.xx.xx

-> set pendingipnetmask=yyy.yyy.yyy.y

-> set pendingipgateway=zzz.zzz.zz.zzz

-> set commitpending=true

Change the role of user1 to operator

-> set /SP/users/user1 role=operator

Display the role of username ‘user1’ (the role will clearly impact which command functionality is available for a user):

-> show /SP/users/user1

Change user1’s password:

-> set /SP/users/user1
password Changing password for user /SP/users/user1/password…
Enter new password:********
Enter new password again:********
New password was successfully set for user /SP/users/user1

ILOM has two serial ports: an internal host port that interfaces directly with the host server using the start /SP/console command, and an external port that is exposed on back of the server.

To disable use of NTP set the NTP-server IP address to none as show below:

-> set /SP/clients/ntp/server/1 address=none

Enable NTP service:

-> cd /SP/clock -> set usentpserver=enabled

Firmware update is complete.
ILOM will not be restarted with the new firmware.
