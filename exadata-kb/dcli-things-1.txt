$ dcli -h
 
Distributed Shell for Oracle Storage
 
This script executes commands on multiple cells in parallel threads.
The cells are referenced by their domain name or ip address.
Local files can be copied to cells and executed on cells.
This tool does not support interactive sessions with host applications.
Use of this tool assumes ssh is running on local host and cells.
The -k option should be used initially to perform key exchange with
cells.  User may be prompted to acknowledge cell authenticity, and
may be prompted for the remote user password.  This -k step is serialized
to prevent overlayed prompts.  After -k option is used once, then
subsequent commands to the same cells do not require -k and will not require
passwords for that user from the host.
Command output (stdout and stderr) is collected and displayed after the
copy and command execution has finished on all cells.
Options allow this command output to be abbreviated.

Return values:
 0 -- file or command was copied and executed successfully on all cells
 1 -- one or more cells could not be reached or remote execution returned
      non-zero status.
 2 -- An error prevented any command execution

Examples:
 dcli -g mycells -k
 dcli -c stsd2s2,stsd2s3 vmstat
 dcli -g mycells cellcli -e alter iormplan active
 dcli -g mycells -x reConfig.scl
