I had this issue "Auto-resize Guest Display" greyed out / disabled on a guest Windows 10 over a Ubuntu 16.04 host, 
I've sorted it out after long search with the simple hint (found in LinuxQuestions org): enable the VirtualBox Guest Additions
Tray Applications in the Task Manager / Startup tab. I know is not the current thread main issue but as this was the first 
result in a Google search with same title hope this will save time to other lost searchers...  :roll: 

Cheers
