dependency of org.slf4j 
groovy.util.logging.Slf4j 
I was writing some learning-code, and used groovy.util.logging.Slf4j 
But, it did not compile looking for org.slf4j.Logger.  
Tried to find where org.slf4j.Logger was included in SG build.gradle or elsewhere, could not find ....

Is it not from groovy ?

groovy.util.logging.Slf4j
is from groovy.  That seems to need the other one: org.slf4j.Logger
I now added this into build.gradle:
compile group: 'org.slf4j', name: 'slf4j-log4j12', version: '1.7.25'

org.slf4j.Logger
This should come from jdk

I dont think so. In sgdm repo, intellij shows it under some gradle library "Gradle: org.slf4j..."

FIGURED OUT THIS:

Slf4j needs one of these:
1. org.slf4j.Logger
2. org.apache.logging.log4j


1. org.slf4j.Logger gives this error:
And does not lot any log level to stdout (like log.info, log.error, log.debug)
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (helloapp.logger.HelloLogger).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.


2. org.apache.logging.log4j
Gives a message:
ERROR StatusLogger No Log4j 2 configuration file found. Using default configuration (logging only errors to the console), 
or user programmatically provided configurations. Set system property 'log4j2.debug' to show Log4j 2 internal initialization 
logging. See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html for instructions on how to configure Log4j 2

But, at least logs log.error stuff to stdout (along with the error message as above):
$ gradlew run
Hello world.
ERROR StatusLogger No Log4j 2 configuration file found. Using default configuration (logging only errors to the console), 
or user programmatically provided configurations. Set system property 'log4j2.debug' to show Log4j 2 internal initialization
logging. See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html for instructions on how to configure Log4j 2
