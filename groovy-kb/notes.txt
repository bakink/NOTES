<artifactId>groovy</artifactId>  
<version>2.4.5</version>

It should show the "Module JDK" and "Groovy Library" - chose JDK 1.8 (adoptopenjdk) and Groovy 2.5.9 (installed by sdkman)

Module name = various01
Its folder will be = groovy1/various01
and 'content root' and 'module file location' same as groovy1/various01

Click 'finish'

This will create a subfolder various01 and a folder 'src' under it

- COMPILER OUTPUT FOLDER
