Create a machine to run packer
- see other notes on what packages that machine should have 

Create a 'OS base image' qcow2 (or other format) image using packer and DVD-ISO
- Give url or filename of the ISO file in config json
- use kickstart file for f/s and other config in config json (with a http server dynamically created by packer to serve it)
- embed root password in the builder packer config json
- install more stuff if necessary - like security packages, security mandated cron jobs (like aide) etc.
  - also like cloud-init
  - using 'scripts' directive in config json
          "scripts": [
        "scripts/install-packages-and-configure.sh"
      ]
      
Create custom images (for different purposes - K8S, Oracle, Postgress etc)
- Use the base image further with packer - instead of using ISO, use the base image qcow2
- Change root password if necessary by embedding a new one

Create VMs using virt-install 
- Use the base or custom images - as needed
- Inject customizations 
  - like root password change using cloud-init ISO file as cdrom (with user-data)
    (cloud-init should be pre-installed in the image though)
